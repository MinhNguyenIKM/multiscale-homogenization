Classify wines as coming from one of three vinyards, located in the same region  in Italy, based on 13 constituents found in the wines through chemical analysis.

Samples may be classified using clustering (using only input data) or with Pattern Recognition or Fitting (with input and target data).

The data set consists of 178 samples.

"wineInputs" is an 13x178 matrix, whose rows are:

1. Alcohol
2. Malic acid
3. Ash
4. Alcalinity of ash  
5. Magnesium
6. Total phenols
7. Flavanoids
8. Nonflavanoid phenols
9. Proanthocyanins
10. Color intensity
11. Hue
12. OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13. Proline

"wineTargets" is a 3x178 matrix, where each column indicates the correct vinyard with a 1 in one element (and zeros in the other two elements).

1. Vinyard #1
2. Vinyard #2
3. Vinyard #3
