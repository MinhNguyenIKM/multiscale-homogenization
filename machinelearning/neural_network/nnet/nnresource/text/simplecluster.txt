Two-element vectors are assigned to four classes.

Samples may be classified using clustering (using only input data) or with Pattern Recognition or Fitting (with input and target data).

The data set consists of 1000 samples.

"simpleclusterInputs" is a 2x1000 matrix of values.

"simpleclusterTargets" is an 4x1000 matrix, where each ith column indicates which category the ith iris belongs to with a 1 in one element (and zeros in the other elements).

----------

This simple example can be solved with the Neural Network Pattern Recognition Tool (nprtool) or Clustering Tool (nctool).
