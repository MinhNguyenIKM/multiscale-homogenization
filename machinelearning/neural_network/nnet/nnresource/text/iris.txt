Classify iris flowers based on four attributes.

Samples may be classified using clustering (using only input data) or with Pattern Recognition or Fitting (with input and target data).

The data set consists of 150 samples.

"irisInputs" is an 4x150 matrix, whose rows are:

1. Sepal length in cm
2. Sepal width in cm
3. Petal length in cm
4. Petal width in cm

"irisTargets" is an 3x150 matrix, where each ith column indicates which category the ith iris belongs to with a 1 in one element (and zeros in the other two elements).

1. Iris Setosa
2. Iris Versicolour
3. Iris Virginica

One category of iris is linearly separable, the other two are not.
