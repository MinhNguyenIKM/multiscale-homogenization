Predict the type of glass, either window glass or non-window glass, based on measurements of the chemical content.

Samples may be classified using clustering (using only input data) or with Pattern Recognition or Fitting (with input and target data).

The data set consists of 214 samples.

"glassInputs" is a 9x214 matrix whose rows are

1. Refractive index
2. Sodium (unit measurement: weight percent in corresponding oxide)
3. Magnesium
4. Aluminum
5. Silicon
6. Potassium
7. Calcium
8. Barium
9. Iron

"glassTargets" is a 2x214 matrix, where each column indicates the correct category with a 1 in one element (and a zero in the other).

1. Window glass
2. Non-window glass
