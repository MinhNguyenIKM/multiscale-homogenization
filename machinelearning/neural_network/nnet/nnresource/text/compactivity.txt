Predict the portion of time a computer runs in user mode based on 21 other computer statistics.

An estimator can be found by Fitting the inputs and targets

This data set has 7898 samples.

"compactivityInputs" is a 21x7898 matrix with these rows:

1. Reads (transfers per second ) between system memory and user memory
2. Writes (transfers per second) between system memory and user memory
3. # of system calls of all types per second
4. # of system read calls per second .
5. # of system write calls per second .
6. # of system fork calls per second.
7. # of system exec calls per second.
8. # of characters transferred per second by system read calls
9. # of characters transfreed per second by system write calls
10. # of page out requests per second
11. # of pages, paged out per second
12. # of pages per second placed on the free list.
13. # of pages checked if they can be freed per second
14. # of page attaches (satisfying a page fault by reclaiming a page in memory) per sec
15. # of page-in requests per second
16. # of pages paged in per second
17. # of page faults caused by protection errors (copy-on-writes).
18. # of page faults caused by address translation .
19. Process run queue size
20. # of memory pages available to user processes
21. # of disk blocks available for page swapping.

"compactivityTargets" is a 1x7898 matrix of proportional times computers ran in user mode.
