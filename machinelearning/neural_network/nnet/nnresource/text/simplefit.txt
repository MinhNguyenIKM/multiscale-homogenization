Estimate the outputs of an arbitrary one-input/one-output function.

An estimator can be found by Fitting the inputs and targets

The data set consists of 67 samples.

"simplefitInputs" is an 1x67 matrix.

"simplefitTargets" is a 1x67 matrix.

----------

This simple example can be solved with the Neural Network Fitting Tool (nftool).
