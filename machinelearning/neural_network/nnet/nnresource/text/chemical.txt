Predict one sensor measurement in a chemical process from eight other measurements, so the first sensor can be removed.

An estimator can be found by Fitting the inputs and targets

The data set consists of 498 samples.

"chemicalInputs" is an 8x498 matrix, whose rows are eight sensor measurements.

"chemicalTargets" is a 1x498 matrix of a ninth sensor measurement.
