Classify whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on nine characteristics of sample biopsies.

Samples may be classified using clustering (using only input data) or with Pattern Recognition or Fitting (with input and target data).

The data set consists of 699 samples.

"cancerInputs" is an 9x699 matrix, whose rows are biopsy characteristics:

1. Clump Thickness
2. Uniformity of Cell Size
3. Uniformity of Cell Shape
4. Marginal Adhesion
5. Single Epithelial Cell Size
6. Bare Nuclei
7. Bland Chromatin
8. Normal Nucleoli
9. Mitoses

"cancerTargets" is a 2x966 matrix, where each column indicates the correct category with a 1 in one element (and a zero in the other).

1. Benign
2. Malignant
