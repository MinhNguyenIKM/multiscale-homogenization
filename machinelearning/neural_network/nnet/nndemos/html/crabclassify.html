         <h2>The Problem: Classification of Crabs<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>In this demo we attempt to build a classifier that can identify the sex of a crab from its physical measurements. Six physical
            characterstics of a crab are considered: species, frontallip, rearwidth, length, width and depth. The problem on hand is to
            identify the sex of a crab given the observed values for each of these 6 physical characterstics.
         </p>
         <h2>Why Neural Networks?<a name="2"></a></h2>
         <p>Neural networks have proven themselves as proficient classifiers and are particularly well suited for addressing non-linear
            problems. Given the non-linear nature of real world phenomena, like crab classification, neural networks is certainly a good
            candidate for solving the problem.
         </p>
         <p>The six physical characterstics will act as inputs to a neural network and the sex of the crab will be target. Given an input,
            which constitutes the six observed values for the physical characterstics of a crab, the neural network is expected to identify
            if the crab is male or female.
         </p>
         <p>This is achieved by presenting previously recorded inputs to a neural network and then tuning it to produce the desired target
            outputs. This process is called neural network training.
         </p>
         <h2>Preparing the Data<a name="3"></a></h2>
         <p>Data for classification problems can very often have textual or non-numeric information. In our case, sex of the crab is non-numeric
            (Male/Female). Neural networks however cannot be trained with non-numeric data. Hence we need to translate the textual data
            into a numeric form.
         </p>
         <p>There are several ways to translate textual or symbolic data into numeric data. Some of the common symbol translation techniques
            used are unary encoding, binary encoding and numbering classes. We are going to use unary encoding in this demo to perform
            symbol translation.

            crabs.
         </p>
         <p>We could also have used numbers to represent the two sexes (Male=1, Female=2) or performed binary encoding (Male=[0 0], Female=[0
            1]).
         </p>
         <p>The next step is to preprocess the data into a form that can be used with a neural network.</p>
         <p>The neural network object in the toolbox expects the samples along columns and its features along rows. Our dataset has its
            samples along rows and its features along columns. Hence the matrices have to be transposed.

fid = fopen('private/crabdata.csv');
C = textscan(fid,'%f%f%f%f%f%f%s','delimiter',',');  % Import data
fclose(fid);

%%
% The first 6 columns of data represent the crab's physical characterstics.
% The 7th column represents the sex of the crab.

physchars = [C{1} C{2} C{3} C{4} C{5} C{6}]; % inputs to neural network

female = strncmpi(C{7}, 'Female', 1);
male = strncmpi(C{7}, 'Male', 1);

sex = double([female male]);                 % targets for neural network

%%
% 'Female' is now represented by the vector [1 0] and 'Male' is represented
% by the vector [0 1]. This process is called unary encoding. The neural
% network will now be trained to produce a [1 0] output for 'Female' crabs

rand('seed', 491218382)

% A 1-hidden layer feed forward network is created with 20 neurons in the

net = newff(physchars,sex,20); % Create a new feed forward network

% Now the network is ready to be trained. The samples are automatically
% divided into training, validation and test sets. The training set is
% used to teach the network. Training continues as long as the network
% continues improving on the validation set. The test set provides a
% completely independent measure of network accuracy.

[net,tr] = train(net,physchars,sex);

%% Testing the Classifier
% The trained neural network can now be tested with the testing samples
% This will give us a sense of how well the network will do when applied
% to data from the real world.

testInputs = physchars(:,tr.testInd);
testTargets = sex(:,tr.testInd);

out = sim(net,testInputs);        % Get response from trained network

%%
% The network response can now be compared against the desired target
% response to build the classification matrix which will provides a
% comprehensive picture of a classifiers performance.

[y_out,I_out] = max(out);
[y_t,I_t] = max(testTargets);

diff = [I_t - 2*I_out];

f_f = length(find(diff==-1));     % Female crabs classified as Female
f_m = length(find(diff==0));      % Female crabs classified as Male
m_m = length(find(diff==-2));     % Male crabs classified as Male
